# Blueprint Workflow

Local-only workflow contract for this project. It holds the Blueprint sections
that normally live in `AGENTS.md`, moved here because this project runs in
local-only visibility: `.claude/`, `blueprint/`, and `CLAUDE.md` are gitignored,
and `AGENTS.md` stays tracked as the public project guide with no workflow
contents.

**Skills that say "see `AGENTS.md`" for the workflow, project configuration, or
dashboard activity contract should read this file instead.** `CLAUDE.md` imports
both, so both are in context every session.

> **This blueprint is an overlay layer**, added on top of an already-scaffolded
> app. Never run a framework scaffolder inside this directory. For a new project,
> scaffold the app first, then overlay these files.

Stack-specific standards apply only to the stack this project actually uses.
`blueprint/context/platform.md` is authoritative for what counts as proof here;
read it before `/check` and before reporting any step complete.

## Read these when relevant

- `blueprint/config.json` - deterministic project workflow settings
- `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` - the project's source of truth
- `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` - read before changing code
- `blueprint/context/platform.md` - what counts as proof on this stack; read before /check
- `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` - read when running the Blueprint workflow
- `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` - the one feature, fix, or rollback being built right now

Reuse relevant context already loaded in the session.

## Project configuration

`blueprint/config.json` is the user-owned, machine-readable workflow policy for
this project. Workflow skills read the relevant settings before acting. A
missing file means built-in defaults. An invalid file falls back to defaults for
read-only status reporting, but mutating workflow commands stop and point to
`/doctor` instead of guessing.

Configuration can make review or verification stricter and can tune local
branch names and automated-mode limits. It never grants permission to commit,
merge, push, deploy, publish, send, delete data, waive a failing check, or accept
a finding. Those approval and safety boundaries are not configurable.

`qualityGates.regular` controls automatic audit, independent-review, check, and
try-guide behavior for the normal workflow and Autopilot.
`qualityGates.continuous` controls the same per-feature gates for Continuous
Mode. The existing `tryGuide` keys select `/check guide`, which generates
instructions without performing verification or recording acceptance.
Independent review defaults to `when-sensitive` in both workflows, while
audit, check, and try guide default to `manual`. Sensitive or unusually broad
work therefore selects independent review automatically; ordinary small work
does not. Setting a workflow's independent review to `manual` disables that
automatic selection, while an explicit `/audit independent current` remains
available. The other conditional modes are `when-sensitive` for audit,
`when-behavioral` for check, and `when-user-facing` for try guides. `always`
runs the gate for every work item in that workflow.

`review.independentExecution` controls how a selected independent-review gate
runs. Its default, `automatic`, uses a fresh isolated reviewer child when the
active adapter can prove isolation, exact reviewer identity and model, and
completion. Otherwise it preserves the request and falls back to the manual
handoff. This setting changes execution only; the quality-gate policy still
decides whether review is selected.
The automatic path spawns a generic child through the current runtime and gives
it the installed project-local Audit skill and review contract. It never requires
or discovers global agent roles, skills, prompts, or TraversyFlow components.
New review requests record requested execution and completed receipts record
actual execution. Manual uses `fresh session`; automatic uses `fresh subagent`;
an explicit automatic fallback records actual manual with `fresh session`.

**This project selected Guided implementation style during `/onboard`:**
`workflow.stepReview: "every"` and `workflow.checkpointCommits: "enabled"`.
`/implement` pauses for approval after every step and offers optional checkpoint
commits. Either value can be changed at any time; a later `/implement` run reads
the current configuration. The final read-only code walkthrough is not a
configuration setting and remains available with every implementation style.

## Workflow

Build one feature, fix, or rollback at a time, behind review gates. Each step's
instructions are plain markdown skills any capable agent can read and follow.

This project installed the Claude Code adapter only: `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`.
There is no `.agents/` tree. If another tool is added later, install its adapter
and keep shared workflow behavior aligned across both folders.

Learn the feature loop: `/feature` -> `/implement` -> `/check` -> `/audit current` ->
`/complete`. Approve the Feature spec before Implement. Check proves behavior;
Audit reviews code and records findings. Showing both in this path does not
change configured gates or make Audit mandatory. `/check guide` only generates
manual instructions and never performs verification or records acceptance.

Core skills:

### Build

- `feature` - turn a build-plan item into a spec, or propose a reviewed plan addition for a genuinely new feature
- `implement` - build the current spec one small, reviewed step at a time
- `check` - prove the current spec on a real simulator, emulator, or device, per
  platform, or use `check guide` for a read-only manual guide: where to go, what
  to tap, what to expect
- `complete` - run the final safety pass, log features, fixes, or rollbacks under `blueprint/history/`, then merge with approval

### Understand and review

- `explore` - investigate an idea against the actual code without writing files or requiring plans
- `brief` - read-only briefing on an upcoming build-plan feature (scope, dependencies, size) before you spec it
- `status` - read-only progress summary, workflow drift warning, and suggested next action
- `debug` - reproduce and isolate a failure without editing code, then hand the evidence to `fix` or `implement`
- `audit` - branch-aware or full-project review across all concerns or a focused quality, security, performance, or tests lens; `audit independent current` prepares an immutable checkpoint for a fresh reviewer session or configured isolated reviewer child; records findings in `blueprint/context/findings.md` and independent receipts in `blueprint/context/review.md`, where blocking findings or stale review state stop `complete`
- `doctor` - Blueprint health check for setup, adapters, plans, overview freshness, dashboard state, and workflow drift; it may offer to reset only malformed generated dashboard state after approval

### Plan and set up

- `onboard` - tune commands, standards, visibility, ignore rules, and tool adapters after overlaying the Blueprint onto a freshly scaffolded or early project
- `adopt` - bootstrap the Blueprint into an existing brownfield app with shipped features
- `discovery` - optional deep, multi-turn planning conversation that drafts the two user-owned plans only after review and approval; direct plan writing remains fully supported
- `overview` - distill the two planning docs into
  `blueprint/context/project-overview.md`, then offer a reviewed initial planning
  baseline commit before Feature 1
- `prototype` - optional, pre-build throwaway native screens to lock navigation and design tokens
- `tests` - set up unit, widget, and component testing by default, or a device-level harness with `tests e2e`
- `ci` - explicitly set up one project-specific Verify command and matching automatic GitHub checks, with an optional local pre-push hook

### Recover and release

- `fix` - document an ad-hoc bug or change into `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`
- `rollback` - plan a safe reversal of a completed feature from its archive and exact git commit, with later-dependency review before code changes
- `release` - optional App Store, Google Play, and internal distribution readiness: versioning, signing, permissions, store requirements, and a real release build

In Claude Code, use the slash commands (`/onboard`, `/discovery`, `/overview`,
`/feature`, and so on). These are AI chat commands, not terminal commands. The
conventions in `blueprint/context/` apply however a step is invoked. `/discovery`
is never required: users may write detailed plans directly or develop them
through any conversation before running `/overview`.

### Automation

Optional explicit-only skill: `autopilot` combines `feature` or `fix` with
`implement` in one bounded pass when directly invoked, including the configured
regular quality gates. The normal workflow stops for human approval of the spec
before implementation; Autopilot continues through that review point. It may
create checkpoint commits on the feature or fix branch after passing steps and
repair confirmed P0/P1 findings when its audit gate runs. It stops before
`/complete`, merge, push, deploy, or destructive actions.

Optional explicit-only skill: `continuous` can resume or select the next planned
feature and repeat the complete local feature lifecycle through the configured
limit or end of the build plan. It creates one branch and one local main commit
per feature, applies the Continuous quality gates, archives and merges serially,
and stops on decisions or failed safety gates. It never pushes, deploys,
publishes, sends, or performs destructive actions.

Distribution is also explicit. `/release` can prepare local store and signing
config and run readiness checks, but it must stop before any upload, store
submission, track promotion, push, or publish unless the user gives a separate
yes in the current chat. A mobile release cannot be rolled back: you cannot
unpublish a build users installed, and you cannot reuse a build number.

## Dashboard activity

The dashboard can show the active or most recent substantial Blueprint command
from `blueprint/.state/run.json`. This file is generated local state, ignored by
Git, and never part of a feature commit.

Commands with meaningful progress or a durable handoff should write it when the
state directory exists: `onboard`, `adopt`, `discovery`, `overview`, `feature`,
`fix`, `rollback`, `implement`, `debug`, `check`, `audit`, `tests`,
`ci`, `prototype`, `autopilot`, `continuous`, `complete`, and
`release`. Short orientation commands such as `explore`, `brief`, `status`, and `doctor`
do not write activity state. The `check guide` mode also never writes activity
state; select the Check mode before any activity call. Doctor's optional
approved reset removes malformed activity instead of recording another run.

Writing the initial activity record is the first action of a tracked command,
before project inspection, preflight, or other tool calls. This one generated
state write does not authorize product changes or bypass any safety check.

Never create or edit `run.json` directly. From the project root, use the helper:

```text
node .claude/skills/doctor/scripts/run-state.mjs <action> <options>
```

Start with `start --command <skill> --summary <truthful-summary> --boundary
<boundary>`. Use `update` at meaningful milestones or for a blocker, with
`--status blocked` and `--resume <exact-command>` when recovery is needed. End
with `finish --status ready|completed --summary <truthful-summary>`. The helper
validates every field before atomically replacing the generated file. If it is
missing or fails, report the activity warning and continue the workflow without
writing a manual fallback.

The helper writes this schema:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "command": "continuous",
  "status": "running",
  "summary": "Completing the remaining build plan",
  "detail": "Implementing feature 3.",
  "boundary": "local-only",
  "startedAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
  "updatedAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
  "resumeCommand": "/continuous resume",
  "progress": { "current": 2, "total": 5, "label": "features" },
  "feature": { "id": "3", "title": "Export reports" }
}
```

`status` must be `running`, `blocked`, `ready`, or `completed`. Use `ready` when
the command reached its intended review handoff, such as Autopilot waiting for
review before `/complete`. Use `blocked` with the exact recovery command when
work can resume. `boundary` must be `read-only`, `reviewed`, or `local-only`.
The progress, feature, detail, boundary, and resume fields are optional. Never
put secrets, raw logs, prompts, or user content in this file. Activity tracking
must not change a command's approval boundaries or turn a reporting failure into
a workflow failure.

## Automatic verification

Automatic GitHub checks are a separate explicit setup. `/onboard` only reports
existing checks and points to `/ci` when none exist. **This project has no
`Verify` command and no `.github/workflows/` yet.** Running `/ci` inspects the
real project and defines one `Verify` command from checks that already exist.
Use this order when available: typecheck, tests, then build. Never invent a test
runner or another check just to fill the command.

Use the stack's native task runner: `flutter` for Flutter. Record the exact
command under Commands in `AGENTS.md`.

The optional `.github/workflows/verify.yml` must run that same command for pull
requests and pushes to the default branch. Preserve existing workflows, use the
project's real runtime and install command, and grant only `contents: read` by
default. This setup does not add coverage, device farms, screenshot testing, store
uploads, or OS-version matrices; those remain later project choices. iOS
compilation needs a macOS runner, which costs several times a Linux one, so
scope that job deliberately. Signing secrets never belong in a pull-request
pipeline. A local pre-push hook that runs the same `Verify` command is offered as
an opt-in at the end of `/ci`, and `git push --no-verify` still bypasses it, so
the remote ruleset stays the lock.

GitHub branch protection or a ruleset can require the check after the repository
is pushed, but that is a separate remote setting. Missing automatic GitHub
checks do not make the Blueprint unusable.

## Local-only visibility

`.claude/`, `blueprint/`, and `CLAUDE.md` are gitignored. Consequences to keep in
mind:

- Blueprint state, specs, findings, and history do not travel with the repo.
  Another machine needs the Blueprint reinstalled or restored locally.
- `.gitignore` still names the ignored paths, so their existence is visible in
  the public repo even though their contents are not.
- `AGENTS.md` must stay free of Blueprint workflow contents, adapter paths, and
  skill lists. Add project description, commands, and coding conventions there;
  add workflow behavior here.
